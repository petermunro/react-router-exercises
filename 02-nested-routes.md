# Using Nested Routes

From React Router v4, routes are nested just like you'd nest a `<div>`.

- `<Route>`s are React components, just like any other component.
- `<Route>`s can be interleaved within `<div>s`, `<nav>s` etc, as normal


> Documentation on nested routes is available [here](https://reacttraining.com/core/guides/philosophy/nested-routes).

1. Create a nested route that routes to:

    - your `Contact` component
    - your `Address` component
    - any other components that you develop
