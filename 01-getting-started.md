# Using React Router

1. To install react-router, follow the installation instructions [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start).

2. First, use the example they provide to get familiar with:
   - `<Route>`
      - What does the `path` represent?
      - What other attributes are there?
   - `<Link>`
   - `<Router>`

3. Now integrate react-router into one of the projects you have developed during this class. It would be great if you could have URLs which direct the user to your:
    - `<TweetBox>`
    - `<ContactList>`
    - `<EditInvoice>`




### Troubleshooting

#### `npm start` fails

If you get an error, eg "sh: react-scripts: command not found", do an `npm install` again. If that doesn't work, follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39959900/npm-start-error-with-create-react-app#answer-39960890).
